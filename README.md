# PAR-Light-Sensor

This project uses a AS7341 light sensor as a low cost alternative to a quantum sensor to make a Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) measurement. This sensor does not have a flat sensitivity throughout the 400-700 nm range, but has seven measurement channels spanning the range. As such, it is most accurate when used with the specific type of light or fixture for which is has been calibrated.

A description of the work to develop and test the sensor can be found in this article.
